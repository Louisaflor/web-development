# web-development
taking a basic course to help me better understand html, css, and a bit of javascript

I was also learning php but I had to stop b/c i want to get into Hack Reactor, so I'm focusing on javascipt and thier free prep course

This has helped me a lot! Without this I probably wouldn't have made the Starbucks website :)
